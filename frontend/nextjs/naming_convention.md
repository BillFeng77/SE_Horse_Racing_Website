# Naming Convention

### 1.Camel Space for function and variable names

Camel case is the practice of writing phrases without spaces or punctuation. It indicates the separation of words with a single capitalized letter, and the first word starting with either case. Common examples include "iPhone" and "eBay".

EX: newsPage; checkAdminPage

### 2. Snake Case for file names

Snake case refers to the style of writing in which each space is replaced by an underscore (_) character, and the first letter of each word is written in lowercase.

Ex: naming_convention; snake_case
